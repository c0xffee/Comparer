# Comparer
A COMPARER can help you comparer two strings includes "\n" with different color.
<br><br>
when i prepare for my CISCO CCNA Certification.
<br><br>
i use it 2 check out if my cisco configuration file on router or switch is correct.
<br><br>
it's really useful when you use paket tracer to practice how to config routers and swirches.
